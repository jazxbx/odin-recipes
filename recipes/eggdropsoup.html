<h2>Rice cooker  Egg Drop Soup is so easy to make at home you won’t ever
  need to order it at a Chinese restaurant again!</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 Eggs (lightly beaten)</li>
  <li>4 cups Chicken Broth</li>
  <li>2 tbsp Freshly grated ginger</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp Salt</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp White Pepper</li>
  <li>1 Green Onion (chopped )</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp Sesame Oil </li>
  <li>3 tsp Corn Starch ( mixed with 1/3 cup water)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in the rice cooker</li>
  <li>Stir in the salt, white pepper, garlic and sesame oil to the simmering stock</li>
  <li>Next, add the cornstarch slurry to the mixture to thicken the stock. Keep stirring until consistency is to 
    your liking.
  </li>
  <li>Now we're ready for the most exciting part: the egg. This recipe calls for the egg to be lightly beaten, which results in both white and yellow egg swirls. The speed at which you stir the soup when adding the egg also determines whether you get large “egg flowers” or small egg flowers (i.e. swirly bits of egg). Use a ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion, 
    and slowly drizzle in the egg until you have added it all.</li>
    <li>Ladle the soup into bowls, top with scallions, and serve!</li>
</ol>
